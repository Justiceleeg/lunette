## Purpose

### Purpose

The purpose of this BrainLift is to establish a pedagogical framework for "Computational Music Thinking"—using live coding not just as a production tool, but as a primary method for teenagers to intuitively learn music theory and composition. It aims to solve the cognitive gap between abstract syntax (Strudel/JavaScript) and immediate sonic feedback.

### In Scope

-   **Pedagogy of Live Coding:** How "iteration" and "hacking" replace traditional "rehearsal" and "notation."
-   **Cognitive Load in Interfaces:** Reducing the friction of syntax to maximize musical flow.
-   **Teenage Motivation:** Leveraging autonomy, identity, and "remix culture."
-   **Direct Mapping:** The relationship between code structures (loops, conditionals) and musical structures (rhythm, form).

### Out of Scope

-   **Technical Implementation:** Next.js stack, database schemas, or LLM API integration.
-   **Traditional Performance:** Physical dexterity (piano/guitar technique).
-   **Traditional DAW Workflows:** Comparisons to Ableton or Logic Pro.

## DOK 4 - Spiky Points of View (SPOVs)

### SPOV 1

**The "Gatekeeper" Consensus is dead. Musical complexity no longer requires physical dexterity or theoretical fluency. In a live coding environment, sophistication is an *emergent property* of the system, accessible to novices immediately.**

**Elaboration:**
Traditionally, "complex" music was a proxy for "skill" because it required years of physical training to execute. This created a "Gatekeeper" effect: you couldn't make "good" complex music until you paid your dues. Lunette proves this false by leveraging **Emergent Complexity**. A beginner can type a simple Strudel function and generate a complex, professional-sounding rhythm instantly. The difficulty shifts from **Execution** (how do I move my fingers?) to **Curation** (does this sound good?). Therefore, the role of the platform is not to "train" the user to build complexity, but to help them *manage* and *understand* the complexity they can already generate.

## DOK 3 - Insights

-   **Insight 1: Retrospective Theory (The "Reverse-Engineering" Model).**
    Traditional music education operates on a **prescriptive** model: students must learn the rules (scales, rhythm) *before* they can meaningfully compose. Lunette enables a **descriptive** (or retrospective) model: the user creates or forks complex sounds first via intuition or hacking, and the AI Teacher's role is to "discover" and label the theory *already present* in that code. In this model, music theory is not a prerequisite for creation; it is a vocabulary for understanding what you have already created.

## DOK 2 - Knowledge Tree

### Category 1: The Learning Environment

**Source:** Seymour Papert & Mitch Resnick

| Level | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DOK 1** | **Low Floor:** Easy to start. **High Ceiling:** No limit to complexity. **Wide Walls:** Supports diverse interests/pathways. |
| **DOK 2** | In Lunette, "Wide Walls" manifests as **non-linear discovery**. There is no "correct" path to learning music theory. A concept like rhythm can be explored through a simple code snippet or a complex algorithm, accommodating variable user journeys without enforcing a rigid curriculum. |

### Category 2: The Feedback Mechanism

**Source:** Sam Aaron & Bret Victor

| Level | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DOK 1** | **Temporal Grounding:** Feedback is immediate; users hear code as it executes. **Visible State:** The interface must show what the code is doing (Playhead). |
| **DOK 2** | The "difficult-to-parse" nature of text-based coding is mitigated by offloading the cognitive effort of "simulation" to the environment. The "Playhead" transforms the code from a set of instructions into a tangible, reactive interface, shifting energy from decoding syntax to evaluating aesthetics. |
